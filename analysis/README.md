# Experiment Overview

This project analyzes an A/B test conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of advertisements on user conversion.

# Objective
To determine whether showing advertisements ("ad" group) leads to a higher conversion rate compared to showing a public service announcement ("psa" group).

# Test Groups
- **Control Group (psa):** Users shown a public service announcement
- **Test Group (ad):** Users shown advertisements

# Primary Metric
- **Conversion Rate:** Number of converted users divided by total users in each group

# Hypothesis
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** There is no difference in conversion rates between the ad and psa groups
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** The ad group has a higher conversion rate than the psa group
